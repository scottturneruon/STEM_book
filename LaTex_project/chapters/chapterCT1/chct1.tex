A recently released book Teaching Computing Unplugged in Primary Schools  edited by Helen Caldwell (University of Northampton) and Neil Smith (Open University) has a number of interesting chapters by authors who are passionate about how computing is taught in schools. The central theme is unplugged activities, without using computers, but still teach the fundamental of computational thinking.

Ok, confession time. I co-wrote, along with Katharine Childs (Raspberry Pi Foudation), Chapter 3 Artists so I am biased here, but I believe in the central theme of Unplugged Computing. Computing, and Computational Thinking in general,  is not just about programming and using a computer (though using computers and  programming are vitally important to Computing) but it is also about many other things including problem-solving, being creative and working collaboratively.

Chapter 3 is about linking these computational thinking ideas to produce visual art, by applying computing principles including  repetition, following and refining algorithms, and abstraction. The chapter also looks, how these links have already being made, with examples such Sol Le Witt where not all the work that was produced by the artist himself, but some by others following his written instructions - in other words an algorithm. There is even a game Thomas's Tangles

The other chapters make links with areas such as Robots, Musicians, Explorers, Magicians, Gamers, Cooks and Scientists.

\section{Thomas Tangles}
This simplifies the algorithm Thomas' Tangles (named after my son who helped develop it) in Chapter 3 of the book discussed in http://compuationalthinking.blogspot.co.uk/2016/11/how-to-be-unplugged-artist.html

Using crayons, pencils or pens, we are going to follow an algorithm to create a random drawing. This could be done in pairs and you will need squared paper. 

Person A: Rolls the dice and reads out the instructions - their role is to roll the dice, interpret the algorithm and tell the 'robot' what to do.

Person B: Is the ‘robot carrying out the instructions'. The lines are solid blocks of colour so move four squares does also mean colour in the squares between the start and finish in the direction of movement.

When a new central square is needed the roles of A and B swap (so A is the ‘robot’ and B rolls the dice and reads out the instruction). The roles keep swapping.

\begin{lstlisting}
Start from a random square – call it the centre square
Repeat until end of game
If die roll = 1
  Roll die for number of moves
 move die roll number of steps up the page
If die roll = 2
  Roll die for number of moves
  move die roll number of steps down the page
If die roll = 3
  Roll die for number of moves
  move die roll number of steps to the left 
If die roll = 4
  Roll die for number of moves
  move die roll number of steps to the right
If die roll = 5
  Roll die
  If die = 1 change colour to Red
  If die = 2 change colour to Blue
      If die = 3 change colour to Black
  If die = 4 change colour to Green
  If die = 5 change colour to Orange
  If die = 6 change colour to Yellow
If die roll = 6
           Roll die
  Return to current centre square
                If the second die roll=6
                   randomly select new centre square
     if block is off the page
                randomly select new centre square
